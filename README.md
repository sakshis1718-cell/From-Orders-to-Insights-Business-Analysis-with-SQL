A SQL-based business analysis project built using data from Kaggle to explore sales performance, customer trends and product insights.  
This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and my capacity to analyze complex data. They exhibit my abilities in data investigation,cleaning,visualization and analysis.

**Project Description :** The insights are generated from an Orders dataset (sourced from Kaggle and transformed in Excel) to analyze key business metrics such as sales revenue, customer trends and product performance.
I utilized SQL to explore the data and answer key business questions to derive actionable insights.

**Tasks Performed :**
- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the datasetand bifurcated them for better understanding.
- Wrote SQL queries to find total number of orders sales, average order value, calculate total revenue from sales, total sales distributed across various years,numbers,ranks and    their region.
- Identified top orders with their sales and profit.
- Calculated Profit margin percentage per order and summary.
- Analyzed and calculated what percentage each order contributes to total revenue.
- Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments and criteria
- Identified top products and analyzed cumulative revenue generated over time.
- Used SQL techniques like SELECT, FROM,WHERE,GROUP BY,ORDER BY,Subqueries, WINDOW Functions and for complex analysis Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Data Cleaning using string/date functions
